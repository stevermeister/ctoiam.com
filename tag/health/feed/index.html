<p>I would like to continue our Productivity journey with the &#8220;Health&#8221; topic which I find super important and in many cases underestimated. Our physical well-being has a direct impact on our mental strength. Here&#8217;s how you can foster a healthy body to boost your willpower:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Water:</strong> Stay hydrated. A well-hydrated body ensures optimal brain function, helping you think clearly and make better decisions. Just try 2-3 glasses a day extra and see the difference. It might be not as easy as you think to develop a habit. I use a phone app for quick reminders.</li>



<li><strong>Fresh Air:</strong> Regular exposure to fresh air can refresh your mind and increase your ability to concentrate. I recommend you buy a CO2 meter, you will be surprised. </li>



<li><strong>Healthy Food:</strong> Nutrient-rich foods fuel the brain, improving cognitive function and distraction resistance. Give your preference for fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins like chicken, fish, eggs, beans, and nuts.</li>



<li><strong>Enough Sleep:</strong> Restorative sleep is vital. A well-rested mind is more disciplined and less prone to impulsivity. 7h &#8211; must. 8h &#8211; better. Important: check what period works best for you.</li>



<li><strong>Nature:</strong> Spending time in nature can rejuvenate your spirit, offering mental clarity and a boost in determination.</li>



<li><strong>Meditation:</strong> Regular meditation practices can enhance self-awareness, self-control, and concentration, all essential components of willpower.</li>



<li><strong>Declutter</strong>: Limit exposure to negative news or pessimistic discussions. Unfollow social media accounts or channels that don&#8217;t add value to your life.</li>
</ul>
